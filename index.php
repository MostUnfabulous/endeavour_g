					<h4>5th February</h4>
					<p>We should be proud of ourshellves. Tonight, Endeavour scuttled into Skorpyron's sombre sanctuary
						and slew the slaughterous subterranean scorpid! There's no claws for concern -
						in a pinch, we cracked his chitin and severed his stinger, violently vaporizing the venomous villain.
						 Looks like we nipped this one in the bud!<p>

								<h2>About Us</h2>
								<p>Endeavour formed at the start of Legion, comprised mostly of veteran players - most of us have been raiding since Classic - and since then,
									 we've rapidly progressed through all raid difficulties. We achieved 7/7M on Jan 10th
									 - killing Mythic Il'gynoth, Cenarius and Xavius in just 3 days, thanks to the effort and perseverance of our awesome raid team</p>

<p>We offer a unique raiding experience - we're a very close-knit, chilled out guild, and while we're definitely serious
 about progression, we want everyone to have fun and enjoy their time playing. Everyone is welcome (and encouraged!) to speak on Discord, we value the input of EVERY player, and we want everyone to join in on the fun.
  If you've got any questions, please don't hesitate to contact one of us in-game - Joicy, Articon, Xerphon and Shammande will be happy to talk.</p>
 <p>We are currently 3/10M, killing both Gul'dan Heroic and Skorpyron Mythic on Feb 5th, and, most recently, killed Mythic Trilliax on 26th February</p>
